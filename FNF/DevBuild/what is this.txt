DevBuild was a cancelled fnf mod that I worked on where each dev would create a song each. The mod would feature the oc's of me, GhostBunny, SkullBite and SquidBowl. This folder however only contains my assets which were created by ghostbunny since it was the only thing finished apart from squidbowls stuff that was used for he's own mod tune takedown I'm not sure if those assets are used anymore but they have been shared online.
